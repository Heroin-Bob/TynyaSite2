                    The purpose of LGBTQIA+ counseling is to provide a safe and supportive space for individuals
                    who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or other gender non-confirming identities to
                    discuss any personal or mental health issues they may be experiencing. This type of counseling
                    can help individuals work through any challenges they may be facing related to their sexual
                    orientation or gender identity, and can also provide a sense of community and acceptance.
                    Some common issues that LGBTQIA+ individuals may seek counseling include discrimination,
                    coming out to friends and family, gender dysphoria, relationship problems, and mental health
                    concerns such as depression and anxiety.
