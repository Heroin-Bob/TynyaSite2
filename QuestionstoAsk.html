                    There are several important questions to ask before starting LGBT counseling, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>What is the purpose of the counseling? Is it to address a specific issue or concern, or is it for general support and guidance?</li>
                        <li>What is the counselor's experience and expertise in working with LGBT individuals?</li>
                        <li>Is the counselor culturally competent and knowledgeable about the unique challenges and experiences of the LGBT community?</li>
                        <li>Is the counselor supportive of the LGBT community and committed to providing non-judgmental, affirming care?</li>
                        <li>Does the counselor use evidence-based approaches and techniques in their work with LGBT clients?</li>
                        <li>Is the counselor licensed and insured, and do they adhere to ethical standards of practice in their work with clients?</li>
                        <li>What are the counselor's fees and payment policies? Are they affordable and feasible for your budget?</li>
                        <li>What are the counselor's availability and scheduling policies? Can they accommodate your schedule and needs?</li>
                        <li>What is the counselor's cancellation policy? Can you reschedule or cancel sessions if necessary?</li>
                    </ul>
