                    It’s painful not to be able to be truly yourself around your family and friends.<br>
                    From a young age, you’ve had to hide your crushes and affections from your family.
                    Your family loves and accepts certain aspects of you, but coming out would be devastating.
                    Holidays and family gatherings are painful affairs. You squirm at uncomfortable questions like,
                    “When are you going to get a (opposite sex) boyfriend/ girlfriend? ”
                    You’re so tired of hiding who you are.
                    Loving who you love shouldn’t hurt.
                    Your parents called it a “phase” and disregarded your attempts at honest communication.
                    It was terrible to see the pain in your parent's eyes when you tried to tell them who you are.<br>
                    <br>
                    Aunts and uncles look at you with disdain like you’re some troublemaker. Many of your family
                    members won’t even speak to you beyond “I’ll pray for you.”<br>
                    You deserve to live freely and share your life with someone you love.<br>
                    Gender counseling and LGBTQ therapy can help support you through difficult times.
