                    Trauma can have a particularly significant impact on LGBTQIA (lesbian, gay, bisexual,
                    transgender, queer/questioning, intersex, and asexual) individuals. LGBTQIA individuals may
                    experience trauma as a result of discrimination, stigma, and violence based on their sexual
                    orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. They may also face challenges in seeking out
                    and accessing appropriate and affirming healthcare and social support, which can further
                    compound the effects of trauma. It is important for individuals who have experienced trauma
                    and are part of the LGBTQIA community to seek out supportive resources and to prioritize self-
                    care in order to manage the impact of trauma.
