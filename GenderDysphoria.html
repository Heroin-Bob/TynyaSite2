                    Gender dysphoria is a condition in which a person experiences significant distress and discomfort due to a mismatch between their gender identity and the sex they were assigned at birth. It can result in feelings of anxiety, depression, and a desire to live as the gender they identify with.<br>
                    <br>
                    Gender questioning refers to the process of exploring and coming to understand one's gender identity, which may or may not involve questioning one's assigned gender. For some individuals, this process may lead to a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, while for others it may not.<br>
                    <br>
                    Both gender dysphoria and gender questioning are complex and nuanced experiences that can be difficult to navigate, but seeking support from a trusted mental health professional can be helpful for individuals going through these experiences. <br>
                    <br>
                    I can help you cope with (and possibly reduce) your gender dysphoria. I may also provide letters and documentation for HRT or Gender Confirmation Surgeries. Let me be your guide for coping.
