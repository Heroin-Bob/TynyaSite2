                   My pronouns are She/Her/Hers. I am a Licensed Professional Counselor in the state of Tennessee. I identify as bisexual, and I am experienced in treating individuals who fall under the LGBTQIA+ umbrella. I specialize in LGBTQIA+ concerns, such as gender questioning, gender dysphoria, transitioning concerns, concerns about coming out, and when appropriate, I can provide letters for HRT or surgery. <br>
                   <br>
                   I'm also trained and experienced in treating grief, Bipolar Disorder, depression, and trauma in LGBTQIA+ communities.<br>
                   <br>
                    I am a member of SAIGE-SOCIETY (Society for Sexual, Affectional, Intersex, and Gender Expansive Identities), ALL OUT, Human Rights Campaign, Tennessee Pride Chamber, and World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH).<br>
                    <br>
                   I graduated from Middle Tennessee State University with a BA in psychology. I attended Trevecca University for my graduate program and received a Master of Arts in counseling. I am a Licensed Professional Counselor, licensed by the state of Tennessee (#2157) with a Mental Health Provider designation. I offer online counseling to all adults in the state of Tennessee. I respect all sexual and gender identities. I will not try to “talk you out of it”; I will help you navigate the difficult waters that are often a mirror image of transition itself. You will be safe, and you will be helped.<br>
                   <br>
                   Besides my passion for counseling, I am a fan of true crime books and documentaries, and I enjoy spending time with my family and close friends. I am an avid animal person, especially when it comes to my dogs.<br>

                    Navi is my 13 year old Shih Tzu. He was once used as a breeder dog, but when his owner thought
                    he and his brothers and sisters were getting too old to breed they were given up to a shelter.
                    A rescue organization found them and took them to various no-kill shelters around town. I met
                    Navi at a local pet store adoption event. He was very shy but very sweet and handsome. He seemed
                    to like me, too, and we've been good friends since then. You may not see him (he's a bit
                    camera-shy) but you may catch a glimpse of him or hear him when he snores or calls out "YIP"
                    while dreaming.

                    Sophie was a rescue owner-surrender who I was lucky enough to adopt. She's a sweetie who you may get a glimpse of from time to time.
