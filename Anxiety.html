                    Anxiety is a common concern among people who identify as LGBTQIA (lesbian, gay, bisexual,
                    transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual). Many LGBTQIA individuals experience anxiety
                    related to stigma, discrimination, and fear of rejection because of their sexual or gender identity.
                    This type of anxiety can be particularly acute for those who are not out to friends or family, or
                    who live in areas where being LGBTQIA is not socially accepted. It is important for LGBTQIA
                    individuals to have a support system of friends, family, and/or mental health professionals who
                    can provide a safe and accepting space to talk about their experiences and concerns. There are
                    also many resources available for LGBTQIA individuals seeking support and information about
                    mental health and well-being.
